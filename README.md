Portfolio

This was quite the challenge getting all of my content to perform the way I wanted. I referenced a ton of material between w3 schools and previous assignments to help me build the structure of both my HTML and CSS.

It is far from pretty but it is as functional as I can get it at this moment. Honestly it makes more sense now than it did this time last week. Im positive I could make this look good with another week of tweeking.
